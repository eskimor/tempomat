\section{Aufgabenstellung}
\label{sec:aufgabe}

The FPGA development board's features, especially the rotary knob and the LCD display, should be used to mimic a speed control system. 
A micropocessor should be implemented on top of the FPGA, running an assembly program which implements the required speed control application. 

Inputs are the rotary knob sensor readings (2 logic signals) and the rotary knob push button logical signal, which should be used as reset. 
The outputs are connected to the LCD display and show the current setpoint value of the speed control. 

The speed should not increase/decrease with more than $5 \frac{km}{h}$ per second to ensure a soft acceleration/deceleration. 

The microcontroller should be implemented using a Von-Neumann architecture and should be able to process one assembly instruction per clock cycle.

\subsection{Beschreibung der Schaltung}
\label{sec:schaltung}

\subsubsection{debff}
\label{sec:debff}

This entity is responsible for debouncing a button. It works by means
of an internal counter which gets reset on any edge of the input
signal. As long as the level of the input signal stays the same, the
counter gets incremented. As soon as the MSb is set, the buffered
input signal is forwarded to the output, synchronously to the global
clock.

As you can see in figure \ref{fig:block} debff is used for debouncing the rot knob inputs: \texttt{rot\_a\_i} and \texttt{rot\_b\_i}.

\subsubsection{rot\_buf}
\label{sec:rot_buf}

rot\_buf is responsible for maintaining a buffer which stores the
desired speed. It takes the debounced \texttt{rot\_a\_i} and
\texttt{rot\_b\_i} from the corresponding debff components and
interprets their levels as commands for increasing or decreasing the
buffer value. Simply a rising edge on \texttt{rot\_a\_i} while
\texttt{rot\_b\_i} is low triggers a buffer increment, a rising edge on
\texttt{rot\_b\_i} while \texttt{rot\_a\_i} is low triggers a buffer
decrement. Both increment and decrement are checked to not overflow,
meaning they are simply cut off at values 255 and 0 respectively.

\subsubsection{tempomat\_cpu}
\label{sec:tempomat_cpu}
The specification demands that one instruction per clock cycle gets
executed, it is suggested to realize this by means of an asynchronous
memory. After some consideration of other techniques to achieve this
requirement, we settled on asynchronous memory and even integrated it
into the CPU. The memory is simply modeled by means of two functions
one for reading commands and one for reading data. We decided to use
two functions to avoid some casts in order to make the code more
readable. The specification requested a Von Neumann architecture, this
requirement is not violated because both functions accept the same
address range. If a proper memory was implemented the functions could
simply be changed to access the same memory and doing the necessary
casts.

We did not like this asynchronous pseudo memory at first, so our
original (very smart) attempt was to implement a proper memory component
as double-data-rate memory. In the code review we got informed that
this is in fact not possible, so we considered pipe-lining, but did
not go for it, because strictly speaking it would not have been
possible to meet the requirement of a single instruction per clock
cycle with pipe lining because of jumps, which would flush the pipe
line resulting in more than one cycle per instruction. We realized
that the only way of meeting the requirements was to go for the
suggestion of an asynchronous memory.

The CPU consists of the already mentioned memory access functions and
a process executing the instructions it finds. The wait instruction is
executed by means of a busy loop which gets executed instead of the
instruction decoder. The CPU basically either executes an instruction
(the \texttt{do\_wait} variable is \texttt{0}) or it waits for a
specified time after a wait instruction (the \texttt{do\_wait} variable
is \texttt{1}).

\subsection{Befehlscodierung}
\label{sec:bef_cod}

We used an enumeration type for the commands, so there was no need
specify codes manually. But due to the nature of enumeration types
starting at \texttt{0} it is easily listed:

\noindent\texttt{ 0  =>  IN\_C}

Read data from the in port. Data from the rot\_buf component is read into the accumulator.

\noindent\texttt{ 1  =>  OUTL\_C}

The lower 4 bits of the accumulator get, converted to the ASCII of the
corresponding hex-digit first, written to the display output buffer.

\noindent\texttt{ 2  =>  OUTH\_C}

The higher 4 bits of the accumulator get, converted to the ASCII of the
corresponding hex-digit first, written to the display output buffer.

\noindent\texttt{ 3  =>  OUTCR\_C}

Output the ASCII code of a carriage return to the display output buffer.

\noindent\texttt{ 4  =>  LDI\_C}

Load immediate value. The next byte in memory is read into the accumulator.

\noindent\texttt{ 5  =>  INC\_C}

Increments the value of the accumulator.

\noindent\texttt{ 6  =>  DEC\_C}

Decrements the value of the accumulator.

\noindent\texttt{ 7  =>  STR\_C}

Stores the value of the accumulator in the \texttt{soll} register.
\noindent\texttt{ 8  =>  LDR\_C}

Load the value of the \texttt{soll} register to the accumulator.
\noindent\texttt{ 9  =>  CMP\_C}

Compare the accumulator with the \texttt{soll} register.

\noindent\texttt{10  =>  JC\_C}

Jump to the address found in the next byte in memory if carry bit is set.

\noindent\texttt{11  =>  JZ\_C}

Jump to the address found in the next byte in memory if zero bit is set.

\noindent\texttt{12  =>  JMP\_C}

Unconditional jump to the address found in the next byte in memory.

\noindent\texttt{13  =>  WAIT\_C}

The next byte in memory is interpreted as a time in milliseconds the
processor has to waist.

\subsection{Testbench}
\label{sec:bench}

% Beschreiben Sie die Testbench und f"ugen Sie das Simulationsresultat ein.

The testbench \texttt{tb\_top} module is connected with its inputs to the outputs of the \texttt{top} module and vice-versa, its outputs with the inputs of the \texttt{top} entity. 
It first initializes the inputs of the \texttt{top} module, thereby testing the reset functionality as well. 
Then, turning the knob up, and then, down again is simulated with two for-loop. 
Important is that the counter does not overflow when reaching the maximum value of 255 and that it doesn't ``underflow'' at 0.

Because it is not possible to directly access signals inside a module without creating an extra port and because the output of the \texttt{lcd\_core} module is not really (easily) tracable/ well-documented, both the \texttt{debff} debouncer module and the \texttt{rot\_buf} module are tested with their own respective testbench modules, \texttt{tb\_debff} and \texttt{tb\_rot\_buf}.

\subsubsection{Simulation Results}

The \texttt{tb\_rot\_buf} module uses assertions to ensure the module behaves correctly in the aforementioned circumstances; no assertion errors where triggered running the simulation. 

The \texttt{tb\_debff} module's simulation results are shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:debff01}; it can be seen that after $600\mathrm{us}$ of a signal being stable, it is passed on to the output. 

The \texttt{tb\_top} module uses similar stimuli as the \texttt{tb\_rot\_buf} module to test the correct behavior of the CPU and execution of the assembly program.
